# CNN-pretrained-from-scratch-comparison

  In this notebook, we will investigate different methods of image classification with CNN. First we will create a CNN model based on 'Alexnet' architecture proposed in 2014 paper (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1404.5997.pdf) of Alex Krizhevsky. We will train and evaluate the model from scratch with the data that we have. Secondly we will obtain the same architecture as a pre-trained model from 'torchvision' library. We will compare the results between model from scratch and pretrained model.

  This project designed to work on Google Drive using Google Colab IPyton Notebook. If you want to recreate the results, you may upload the notebook to your drive along with the data. Project data can be downloaed from following Google Drive link: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1VIG6g6iePvAoYtj_XejTmLbH6UpW3i1V
